* XMonad configuration

** Introduction

This is my configuration, still simple.

My goal is to create a good workflow for me to work with Emacs and Firefox.

Another important thing is that I should be able to use Steam and play games without problems.

** Software I use

I use picom, rofi and xmobar for this setup and the configuration files for those are in included in this repo.
The reason for this is that I dislike having .git in my home directory and most of the stuff in ~/.config I dont want to commit to Git.
My Emacs configuration can be found in a separate repo.
